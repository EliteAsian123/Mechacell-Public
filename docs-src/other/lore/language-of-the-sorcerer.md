# BƵƂΣ Ɛ ƂSGΣL (Language of The Sorcerer)

*In the Desert and the Demonic Layer lies The Sorcerer and their projections. All beings related to, or associated with The Sorcerer speak this so-called "Language of The Sorcerer" (or "BƵƂΣ Ɛ ƂSGΣL").*

In Mechacell, the "Language of the Sorcerer" is a very simple conlang that The Sorcerer and their correspondents use. This is a wiki page on this language and how *you* can read and speak it.

#### Vowels

Only `/ə/` [br**uh**], except for (Ɛ) which uses `/u/` [b**oo**t].

#### (Ɛ)

The character (Ɛ) has a similar meaning to *of* in English and is also the only verb (see Grammar). It is the only letter that is used more like a word than a letter and is pronounced `/mu/` [moo].

## Speaking

Let's start with a basic example: BƵƂΣ Ɛ ƂSGΣL. As stated before, this approximately translates to "(The) Language of the Sorcerer" and is pronounced: [`/bəʐəxəkə mu xəðəməkəjə/`](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=b%C9%99%CA%90%C9%99x%C9%99k%C9%99%20mu%20x%C9%99%C3%B0%C9%99m%C9%99k%C9%99j%C9%99) or [b-uh-`/ʐ/`-uh-`/x/`-uh-k-uh moo `/x/`-uh-th-uh-m-uh-k-uh-y-uh].

Another example would be BƂ CGΣ Ɛ TL, which means "you will die." This sentence is pronounced: [`/bəxə t͡ʃəməkə mu təjə/`](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=b%C9%99x%C9%99%20t%CD%A1%CA%83%C9%99m%C9%99k%C9%99%20mu%20t%C9%99j%C9%99) or [b-uh-`/x/`-uh ch-uh-m-uh-k-uh moo t-uh-y-uh].

The following phrases are present in Mechacell at this time:
- GƂ ƵGΣ Ɛ CLƂG BƂ (I am awaiting you)

## Grammar

Every sentence in BƵƂΣ Ɛ ƂSGΣL takes on a structure that looks something like this: `NOUN TENSE "Ɛ" ADJECTIVE (NOUN)`. Here we see that there are no verbs in BƵƂΣ Ɛ ƂSGΣL. This is mostly true except (Ɛ) is technically the verb, which in this context means "which is." So, as an example, BƂ CGΣ Ɛ TL means "you will die," and according to the sentence structure, "BƂ" is a noun, "CGΣ" is the tense, and "TL" is the adjective.
